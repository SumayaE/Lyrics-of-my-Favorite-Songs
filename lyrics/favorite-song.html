	<i>I'm jealous of the rain<br />
	That falls upon your skin<br />
	It's closer than my hands have been<br />
	I'm jealous of the rain<br />
	I'm jealous of the wind<br />
	That ripple through your clothes<br />
	It's closer than your shadow<br />
	Oh, I'm jealous of the wind,</i> cause<br /><br />
	I wished you the best of<br />
	All this world could give<br />
	<i>And I told you when you left me<br />
	There's nothing to forgive<br />
	But I always thought you'd come back, tell me all you<br />found was<br />
	Heartbreak and misery</i><br />
	It's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way<br />
	You're happy without me<br /><br />
	I'm jealous of the nights<br />
	That I don't spend with you<br />
	I'm wondering who you lay next to<br />
	Oh, I'm jealous of the nights<br />
	I'm jealous of the love<br />
	Love that wasn't here<br />
	Gone for someone else to share<br />
	Oh, I'm jealous of the love, cause<br /><br />
	I wished you the best of<br />
	All this world could give<br />
	And I told you when you left me<br />
	There's nothing to forgive<br />
	But I always thought you'd come back, tell me all you<br /> found was<br />
	Heartbreak and misery<br />
	It's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way<br />
	You're happy without me<br /><br />
	As I sink in the sand<br />
	Watch you slip through my hands<br />
	<i>Oh, as I die here another day<br />
	Cause all I do is cry behind this smile<br /><br />
	I wished you the best of<br />
	All this world could give</i><br />
	And I told you when you left me<br />
	There's nothing to forgive<br />
	But I always thought you'd come back, tell me all you<br /> found was<br />
	Heartbreak and misery<br />
	It's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way<br />
	You're happy without me<br /><br />
	It's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way<br />
	You're happy without me<br />
